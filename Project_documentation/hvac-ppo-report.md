## Approach and Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

The implementation begins with a methodical approach to preprocessing the HVAC and weather datasets, focusing on practical feature selection and creation:

- **Temporal Feature Extraction**: Converted timestamps into actionable time features (hour, day of week, weekend indicators)
- **Physical System Modeling**: Created domain-specific features including temperature differentials between indoor/outdoor environments and supply/return air, which directly capture the thermodynamic relationships in HVAC systems
- **Predictive Lag Features**: Implemented strategic lag features for critical parameters like valve position and temperatures to capture system dynamics and temporal dependencies
- **Data Cleaning**: Applied robust handling of missing values using forward-fill then backward-fill methodologies to maintain data continuity
- **Feature Scaling**: Utilized RobustScaler to normalize features while preserving the impact of outliers, which are often important signals in HVAC systems

The preprocessing pipeline demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of both the technical aspects of machine learning and the domain-specific requirements of HVAC systems.
